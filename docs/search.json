The simplest way to define the are of interest to look for in the catalog are:\n\na GeoJSON-type dictionary with coordinates of the bounding box\nas a list [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax] with the coordinate values definind the four corners of the bounding box.\n\nYou could also use a point, or some more complex polygon.\nIn this lesson we will look for NAIP scenes over Santa Barbara from 2018 to 2020. We’ll use the GeoJSON method: to define the area of interest:\n\n\nCode\n# temporal range of interest\n# CHECK: how to get open/close time ranges\ntime_range = \"2018-01-01/2023-01-01\"\n\n# NCEAS

    "title": "Data Accessibility in North Korea",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The yearning for reunification holds great importance for many Koreans, a desire to bridge the gap caused by separation. During the Korean War, my grandparents’ move from North to South Korea resulted in the heartbreaking disconnection from our relatives. Despite the passage of time, political barriers have left us unable to reach to their family in the North, leaving a void of information about their well-being. The difficulty in obtaining any updates from North Korea intensifies our distress, leaving us in the dark about the lives of our loved ones there.\nEnvironmental Challenges Amid Political Complexity While prioritizing environmental issues is a consensus shared by many globally, it might not resonate similarly in Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Small Island Developing States (SIDs), or several African nations. Their existence is deeply entwined with adversity—war, famine, hunger, and poverty—which overshadows environmental concerns. Consequently, obtaining comprehensive data resources from these countries remains an ongoing struggle. North Korea faces a similar plight, grappling with hunger, famine, and a high mortality rate stemming from these issues. Expecting them to prioritize collecting environmental data becomes an impractical demand.\nRecent reports of flooding in North Korea resulted in significant damage to their crops, exacerbating deforestation caused by logging and cultivation. They are critically exposed to hunger and famine. Their ability to engage in sustainable activities has been severely hindered by environmental disasters. They are in dire need of substantial aid from other nations to ensure food security. However, the absence of adequate data makes it challenging to predict the extent of their suffering and devise effective assistance strategies. [1]\n\nTransparent Environmental Data\nThe fields of data science and the environment should be open sources because environmental issues transcend borders and require global protection. Yet, this poses a sensitive matter, with private technologies reluctant to relinquish profits by divulging crucial data. Acknowledging missing data is crucial, exemplified by the “The pentagon, climate change, and war” by Crawford, gleaned from lectures such as the one illustrating the US military’s efforts toward carbon reduction.\nDespite the necessity for most data to be transparent in safeguarding the environment, numerous countries withhold information due to political motives. Countries like China, Russia, and notably North Korea have a significant impact on global environmental dynamics, yet their data remains undisclosed due to political agendas. While working at the Green Climate Fund, I delved into various nations’ National Designated Authority (NDC) reports on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Although some countries, particularly smaller ones like island nations, demonstrate optimistic goals for emission reduction through renewable energy and electric vehicles, China, Russia, and notably North Korea, present challenges in obtaining crucial environmental data.\n\n\n\n\n\nSatellite data has been instrumental in acquiring insights into North Korea’s forests and land use. However, much of this data remains concealed due to political constraints. During my studies of climate change law at Columbia University, I realized the extent to which environmental science intertwines with legal frameworks, emphasizing the role of political decisions in environmental matters. North Korea faces a similar scenario, heavily reliant on government decisions and propaganda, omitting itself even from the LDCs categories, complicating efforts to assist the country due to a lack of comprehensive data sources.\nStrategies for Addressing North Korea’s Environmental Challenges\nIn light of these challenges, determining North Korea’s environmental priorities to combat climate change and avert future crises becomes imperative. Despite the scarcity of data, information from sources like the offers some insight, albeit limited to specific areas, potentially leading to biased data due to limited resources. Overall, the need for reunification in Korea remains a poignant hope, while addressing environmental concerns in North Korea requires a concerted effort to access vital data and devise strategies that transcend political barriers for a sustainable future.\nHow to overcome this situation? To navigate situations akin to North Korea’s challenges, looking at comparable cases like Myanmar and Eritrea offers valuable insights. Myanmar, once under prolonged political isolation like to North Korea, underwent political reforms that improved transparency, enabling better access to environmental data. This shift allowed for enhanced monitoring and conservation efforts, highlighting the positive impact of political openness. Similarly, Eritrea faced isolation due to political factors, hindering environmental solutions. However, partnerships with international agencies and improved collaboration with neighbors have gradually enabled better environmental monitoring and resource management. These examples emphasize the pivotal role of political reforms, international collaboration, and transparency in overcoming limitations to address environmental challenges in politically isolated nations.\nWhile Myanmar and Eritrea exemplify progress achieved through political reforms and international collaboration to address environmental challenges, North Korea’s situation remains distinct due to its prolonged political isolation. Unlike Myanmar’s recent reforms or Eritrea’s partnerships, North Korea’s closed-off regime presents a more complex scenario. The lack of transparent access to environmental data in North Korea hinders global efforts to comprehensively tackle environmental concerns. [3][4]\nUnique Challenges in North Korea\nHowever, drawing from successful strategies applied elsewhere, such as Myanmar and Eritrea, provides a blueprint for potential avenues in addressing North Korea’s environmental issues. Engaging in diplomatic dialogues and fostering international partnerships could facilitate access to crucial environmental data. International organizations could play a pivotal role in encouraging transparency and advocating for information sharing on environmental matters, thereby aiding North Korea’s efforts to monitor and address environmental challenges. By leveraging lessons learned from comparable cases and employing innovative diplomatic approaches, there is potential to navigate the unique challenges North Korea presents in addressing its environmental issues.\nData Reconciliation Post-Reunification\nFurthermore, the potential reunion of North Korea and South Korea raises several critical considerations regarding environmental issues and data collection. Achieving data reconciliation between the two Koreas post-reunification would present a significant challenge requiring a multifaceted approach. Essential aspects would involve aligning disparate data systems, fostering transparency, and encouraging information exchange. Establishing standardized protocols, investing in capacity development, seeking international collaboration, and managing transitional phases would be pivotal. However, the success of this complex undertaking would heavily rely on political willingness, diplomatic efforts, and a gradual integration process that acknowledges the intricacies of merging distinct data frameworks. Resolving data disparities demands a comprehensive strategy entwining technological progress, collaborative institutions, and diplomatic initiatives to facilitate unified and coherent data practices following reunification.\n\nIn conclusion, the quest for reunification in Korea holds immense significance, coupled with the urgency to address environmental concerns in North Korea. The emotional toll of separation persists, compounded by political barriers that sever ties with relatives in the North. Despite global consensus on environmental priorities, challenges in obtaining comprehensive data persist, hindering effective solutions. The need for transparency in data sharing for global environmental protection is evident, yet political motives impede progress. Strategies derived from comparable cases offer potential avenues for addressing North Korea’s environmental issues. Moreover, the complexity of data reconciliation post-reunification necessitates multifaceted approaches, emphasizing the crucial role of political willingness and international collaboration. To forge a sustainable future and navigate North Korea’s unique challenges, concerted efforts bridging political divides and technological advancements are imperative.\nReference\n[1] North Korea’s Kim blasts ‘irresponsible’ top officials for flood damage: https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-koreas-kim-blasts-irresponsible-top-officials-flood-damage-2023-08-22/\n[2] The pentagon, climate change and war, Crawford pp.103 - 177\n[3] https://hir.harvard.edu/why-has-the-world-forgotten-about-myanmar/\n[4] https://er.usembassy.gov/our-relationship/policy-history/\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{kim2023,\n  author = {Kim, Haejin},\n  title = {Data {Accessibility} in {North} {Korea}},\n  date = {2023-12-09},\n  url = {https://khj9759.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-my-blog-post/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nKim, Haejin. 2023. “Data Accessibility in North Korea.”\nDecember 9, 2023. https://khj9759.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-my-blog-post/."
