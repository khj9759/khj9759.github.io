## Title or description 
Air Quality Analysis of Thomas Fire

## About
This project aims to generate a false color image illustrating the fire scar left by the 2017 Thomas fire. The task involves utilizing Air Quality Index (AQI) data from the US Environmental Protection Agency to visualize the impact of the Thomas Fire on air quality in Santa Barbara County.

## Visualization  
Produce a line graph showcasing the daily Air Quality Index (AQI) and the 5-day mean. Exhibit a false-color picture comprising shortwave infrared (SWIR), near-infrared (NIR), and red bands. Moreover, superimpose the boundary of the Thomas fire on this map. You can locate this image in the image/ directory.


## Highlight
- Utilized Pandas for comprehensive data wrangling and exploration.
- Employed GeoPandas for efficient geospatial data manipulation.
- Developed and customized a choropleth map to visualize data spatially.
- Crafted legends using matplotlib.patches to enhance map readability.
- Leveraged rioxarray and xarray for efficient raster data handling and operations.
